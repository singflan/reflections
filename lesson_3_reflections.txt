When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you lost or broke your computer than it'd be great to have the code stored elsewhere. Also, if you are in another location or on a different computer, you can grab the code and work on it from anywhere. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The remote repository is public and there may be changes you’ve made that you don’t want people to download and seeing in your project as the changes may have temporarily made the code unworkable. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone makes a copy of an existing repository, whether it is a local repository or a Github repository. A fork is a clone of a github repository and automatically adds it to your Github repository. A branch is a creating a new commit that creates its own history. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you lose access to the internet you are sure to have the most recent version of the code to work on. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could collaborate by copying code to a drive and then giving it to someone else. You could also save and rename the file with a different version. It’s probably easier to understand but you can’t give names to the changes and it’s tougher to get the code to others and back to yourself. Git and github make it easy to make separate copies and update and merge, which is nice. It shows you the difference so you don’t have to review the entire code.
